        <h1>the (: ABC :) machine</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            The (: ABC :) machine is a tool that provides a front end user interface 
            for text clustering task using SBERT/UMAP/HDBSCAN, or to make it simple, 
            it tries to cluster (or classifies) human readable texts into groups 
            within a few mouse clicks.
        </p>
        <h2>Why do I need it?</h2>
        <p>
            This tool is created originally to assist chat-bot creation for a  
            company by clustering human chat logs to aid sentence pattern searching and also 
            to find flow patterns of a chat. But of course any tasks involving sentence/
            document clustering can be done with this tool (albeit may not be ideal).
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a professional, you may know how to do the work with the tools you 
            already have, but this tool is still handy for you for idea searching or quick/
            casual works by removing all coding and debudding needs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even if you are not a professional, you will find this tool easy to use 
            for a number of task you may be interested with. For example, you may 
            want to classify user reviews of your products to have a general idea how 
            if behaves.
        </p>
        <h2>Is this tool for production time deployment (ie. real time text prediction)?</h2>
        <p>
            This tool is ready for production use with easy to use API via WebSocket, that 
            is, it can be deployed in the cloud with multiple instances for real-time 
            clustering (which is a requirement for a chat-bot). And of course slight 
            modification is necessary to best suit your needs (security, network structures, 
            etc.)
        </p>
        <h2>How do I begin with?</h2>
        <p>
            Actions are hidden inside the hambuger menu in the top left corner, and 
            every actions should be self-explainary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's take a look of an example, first you have to prepare your dataset, 
            you may try <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/veeralakrishna/relational-strategies-in-customer-servicersics">RSICS dataset from Kaggle</a>, 
            download and extract it, and we will only use <i>tagged_selections_by_sentence.csv</i> for clustering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now from the hamburger menu and select <b><i>Upload</i></b>, drag and drop 
            <i>tagged_selections_by_sentence.csv</i> into the center box, and a table 
            should be appear below the box, and that makes the preview of the dataset.
            <p>
                <i>
                    For identification, you may want to change your model's name by clicking on the 
                    name of the model, which is on top of the <b>Basic</b> banner and defaults 
                    to a date-time value.
                </i>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            We are using the 5th column as input (or the 4th one is also OK if you wish), 
            so click on the drop-down box in the 5th column and choose <b><i>Text</i></b> to indicate 
            that column is the input text column. With that set, click <b><i>Begin Upload</i></b> in 
            the dialog to continue.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although not used in this example, there are other types of columns you may 
            be interested in:
            <table>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Text</td>
                        <td>The input text column</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Reference</td>
                        <td>The reference column just for your reference :)</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Timestamp</td>
                        <td>A date/time column for topic-over-time analysis</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Target</td>
                        <td>Theprediction target column for semi-supervised / 
                            supervised clustering, in the case of semi-supervised 
                            training, a value of -1 means no target.
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Predict / Distance</td>
                        <td>The actual training result, exported by this tool</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Set</td>
                        <td>An indicator which dataset is the row belongs to. 
                            If not provided every row belongs to training set.</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
        </p>
        <p>
            After uplading finished, the next step is to create a model, from the 
            hamburger menu select <b><i>Create Model</i></b>, and because we use only 
            default parameter here, simply click on <b><i>Create Model</i></b> to continue.
            <p>
                <i>Note: Model creation may take minutes.</i>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            After model creation is finished, it's now time to train our model! Again 
            from the hamburger menu select <b><i>Training / Testing</i></b>, and simply 
            click on the <b><i>Begin Training on train set</i></b> button and model 
            training will be started.
            <p>
                <i>
                    Note: While most of the training step is fast, embedding creation 
                    may take hours depending on which embedding model did you choose 
                    and how large your dataset is.
                </i>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            And that's all! After training is finished you can see the group number of 
            each sentence in the <b>Data</b> tab, while in the <b>Groups</b> tab you will 
            see how sentences are clustered into different groups and how are they related 
            with the (clumsy) tree view, with also some simple statictics on 
            how well the model performs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the tool you may want to use for analysis:
            <ul>
                <li>Click on the group number for some more details about the group.</li>
                <li>Data filtering can be done with <b><i>Advanced Filter</i></b> button.</li>
                <li>Scatter plot can be use for a brief look on sentence/group relationships</li>
                <li>Highlighting on a dataset row gives you a color scale on sentences similarity</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Notes on scatter plot</h2>
        <p>
            The scatter plot is a 2D representations of how sentence/documents/groups 
            related to each other, but it is because there is no way to 
            create a accurate 2D projection for embeddings which has 200+ dimensions 
            in the original space, distance between points may be be well represented 
            so the plot is only for reference.
        </p>
        <p>
            The original plot is actually 3D, because, well, 3D has one more dimension 
            than 2D! But it turns out 3D chart is more difficult to use (navigating 
            is a pain) and therefore I switched back to 2D scatter plots. Nevertheless, 
            it is not that difficult to switch back to 3D so feel free to try if you wish to.
        </p>
        <h2>Grouping are sparse / It created so many groups!</h2>
        <p>
            First of all, this tool is originally design for sentence 
            clustering for chat-bot making, so it is supposed to make as many groups as 
            it can find to spot the slightly different meanings between each sentences, 
            as <i>"How do I change my email?"</i> should have different response than 
            <i>"Can I change my email?"</i>, which may look similar with topic-modelling.
        </p>
        <p>
            After-all one can reduce groups by "grouping the group", but one cannot 
            increase group counts without "clustering the cluster" again. Both requires 
            additional work, but the former must be easier than the latter IMO.
