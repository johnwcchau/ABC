# the (: ABC :) machine 

## What is this?
The (: ABC :) machine is a tool that provides a front end user interface 
for text clustering task using SBERT/UMAP/HDBSCAN, or to make it simple, 
it tries to cluster (or classifies) human readable texts into groups 
within a few mouse clicks.

## Why do I need it?
This tool is created originally to assist chat-bot creation for a  
company by clustering human chat logs to aid sentence pattern searching and also 
to find flow patterns of a chat. But of course any tasks involving sentence/
document clustering can be done with this tool (albeit may not be ideal).

If you are a professional, you may know how to do the work with the tools you 
already have, but this tool is still handy for you for idea searching or quick/
casual works by removing all coding and debudding needs.

Even if you are not a professional, you will find this tool easy to use 
for a number of task you may be interested with. For example, you may 
want to classify user reviews of your products to have a general idea how 
if behaves.
