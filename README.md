# ABC 
### (: the automatic BERT clustering machine :)

ABC is a package containing both UI front-end and machine learning back-end for text clustering task using BERT model. The goal is to provide easy to use interfaces and dashboards for general clustering task.

## Bugs / Issues
Everything is rough here, you will definitely if you do uncommon things, generally:
- Do not modify (move / delete) data set after training (unless you retrain before saving checkpoint)
- Do not ask for trend data without timestamps in dataset
